# PokemonClassifiers

The model must first be trained before any testing can be performed. To do this simply run the training.m file, which trains the model based on all the images within the Training folder. Once this is completed, run the testing.m file to use the model to predict all the image instances within the Testing folder. To alternate between the 1NN and Nayive Bayes classification methods, simply change the METHOD variable in the testing.m file to either 1NN or NaiveBayes.
